We implemented a multi-class classification approach for disaster assessment from the given data set of post earthquake satellite imagery. The idea was to classify the different damage types in an image.

## Introduction
We need to extract data from the post earthquake imagery training set and classify buildings on the basis of how damaged they are.
The buildings are classified into 5 types .i.e:
* Destroyed buildings
* Major Damaged buildings
* Minor Damaged buildings                                         
* No damaged buildings
* Unclassified

We further need to assign their respective colours to the classified objects in the image. This data is then to be trained in our network and should give us the classification with colour-codes as given. This will require the concepts of deep learning and computer visions to be thoroughly applied.
